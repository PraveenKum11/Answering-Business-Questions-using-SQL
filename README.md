# Answering Business Questions using SQL
- This is a Guided Project form DataQuest.

- In this project I have cleaned and made basic analysis about the Car Sales Data *
Below are some conclusions I came up with :-

## Conclusion
**Which genre is the best for the business to purchase?**  
We can clearly see from the data above that for a business in usa(in this case for us), the best choice will be **Punk** with **12.3%** of market share then **blues(3.4%)**,**pop(2%)** and finally **hip hop(1.9%)**.  

Therefore we should first add **Red Tone(Punk), Slim Jim Bites(Blues) and Meteor and the Girls(Pop)**.  

**Who is the best and worst Sales Employee? Is there any reason for their performance difference?**
* Clearly, Jane has the best performance as her clients had spent the most in total (ie-buyer_sum) as well as they have spent the most per session (cost_per_session).
* Margaret is slightly behind Jane.
* Steve has the worst performance with the lowest buyer_sum and cost_per_session.
- **The one factor that could explain this is the hire_date/experience in the field, Jane has the highest exp then Margaret has slightly lower exp and finally Steve has the least exp, thus the relatively worst performance.**  

**What are the most profitable countries?**
- **From the table above we can clearly infer that Czech Republic, UK, India, and Germany are the most profitable countries.**  
- *It's worth keeping in mind that because the amount of data from each of these countries is relatively low. Because of this, we should be cautious spending too much money on new marketing campaigns, as the sample size is not large enough to give us high confidence. A better approach would be to run small campaigns in these countries, collecting and analyzing the new customers to make sure that these trends hold with new customers.*
